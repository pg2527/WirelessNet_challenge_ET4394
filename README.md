I have include the matlab file and the csv files to show the bitstream extracted form the encoded RFID responses.
For analysis of the generated bitstreams, I have taken help of [EPC Global Standard Specification for RFID](http://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/docs/epc/uhfc1g2_1_2_0-standard-20080511.pdf)

The results of bitstreams along with decoded messages are displayed in the Matlab command window.
